## Open side panel

To use Twinny chat open the side panel using the extension icon or by using the keyboard shortcut `CTRL+SHIFT+Z CTRL+SHIFT+T`.  You can then start typing.  Twinny will retain the chat history between sessions.  You can find the chat history by clicking on the history icon on the side panel.

## Context and code selection

When you highlight/select code in your editor Twinny will use that as the context for the chat message.  If you have not selected any code then it will use the message alone and any previous messages. You can also right click on selected code and select a Twinny option to refactor, explain and other actions.
