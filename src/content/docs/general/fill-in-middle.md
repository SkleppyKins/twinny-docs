To use Twinny to fill in the middle of a code snippet, just start typing in the editor and Twinny will autocomplete for you. Very similar to how Github Copilot works.

If you prefer to trigger code completion manually turn off automatic inline code completion in the settings menu which can be found at the top of the Twinny side panel, and then use the keyboard shortcut `ALT+\` to trigger code completion.

Github Copilot and Twinny share the same keyboard shortcuts, so might interfere with each other enable and disable them as needed.
